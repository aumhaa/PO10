PO10 ===

PO10 v1.0

How to make this work:

1) You MUST be using the most current version of Live! (as of this writing, version 10.0.4).

2) Download this repository.  Put the "PO10" or “PO10-master” folder
inside Max’s packages folder:  ~/Documents/Max 8/packages

3) Copy all the *FOLDERS* from inside the PO10/Python Scripts/ folder to Live’s MIDI Remote Scripts folder.
(The individual scripts require the "aumhaa" and "Debug" folders in order to work)

*(Make sure you copy ALL THE FOLDERS FROM INSIDE the "Python Scripts" and "Livid Python Scripts" folders, not the "Python Scripts" or "Livid Pythons Scripts" folders themselves!)*

If you find issues, please log it in github or send me an email directly.
